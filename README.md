# Summary

Hello! My name is Georgios Nikolaidis and I am an experienced analytics professional with a demonstrated history of working in the financial services industry. Skilled in R, Python, SAS, SQL, Microsoft Office, Statistical Data Analysis and Machine Learning. Regarding my education I will be joining King's College London for a MSc in Data Science (September 2022) which alongside with my integrated master's degree focused in Applied Mathematics from National Technical University of Athens will provide me with all the necessary skills to enter the world of data science. Bellow you can find my portfolio of data science and programming projects completed for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. 

*Note*: For details about projects which I have completed on a production - work related environment you can reach me on: giwrgos.nikolaidis@icloud.com

- ### [Comparative Study of Clustering Algorithms with Application to Medical Data](https://github.com/GiwrgosN/Comparative-Study-of-Clustering-Algorithms-with-Application-to-Medical-Data)

In the context of my thesis for National Technical University of Athens, 3 clustering algorithms (K - means, Single Link, DBSCAN) are examined as well as their effectiveness with the use of medical data (patients with breast cancer). Purpose of applying these algorithms is the choice of the one with the best results as well as the answer to the question of whether they can be used to predict breast cancer.

*Tools*  : R  
*Dataset*: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Coimbra

- ### [Car Rental Database](https://github.com/GiwrgosN/CarRental)

Developed a website for a car rental company. The user could make revervations, delete a reservation or update an existing one. The car rental company could have many stores which the user would be able to choose from. The user interface was made using html,CSS and Javascript and all the data were stored in a database using MySQL.

*Tools*: MySQL, PHP, Javascript, jQuery, HTML, CSS

- ### [Implementation of Four Russians Algorithm](https://github.com/GiwrgosN/FourRussiansAlgorithm)

Four russians algorithm is a matrix multiplication algorithm. The main purpose of this project was to implement this algorithm in Python.

*Tools*: Python 

- ### [Computational Statistics](https://github.com/GiwrgosN/Computational-Statistics)

Implementation of E-M algorithm, bootstrap for linear regression, Lasso, kernel density estimation, rejection method and cross validation.

*Tools*: R
