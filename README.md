# Summary

Hello! My name is Georgios Nikolaidis and I am an experienced credit risk analyst with a demonstrated history of working in the financial services industry. Skilled in R, Python, SAS, SQL, Microsoft Office, Statistical Data Analysis and Machine Learning. Regarding my education I will be joining King's College London for a MSc in Data Science (September 2022) which alongside with my integrated master's degree focused in Applied Mathematics from National Technical University of Athens will provide me with all the necessary skills to enter the world of data science. Bellow you can find my portfolio of data science and programming projects completed for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. 
**** Note: For details about projects which I have completed on a production - work related environment you can reach me on: giwrgos.nikolaidis@icloud.com

- ### [Comparative-Study-of-Clustering-Algorithms-with-Application-to-Medical-Data](https://github.com/GiwrgosN/Comparative-Study-of-Clustering-Algorithms-with-Application-to-Medical-Data)

In the context of my thesis for National Technical University of Athens, 3 clustering algorithms are examined as well as their effectiveness with the use of medical data (patients with breast cancer). Purpose of applying these algorithms is the choice of the one with the best results as well as the answer to the question of whether they can be used to predict breast cancer.

Initially reference is made to the 3 different algorithms (K - means, Single Link, DBSCAN) and to basic concepts such as how they function, correctness, various parameterization techniques as well as time and space complexity. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of each one over the others are mentioned. In order to compare the above methods, reference is made to evaluation indicators implemented using the R package software.

Finally a graphical presentation of the data and application of the algorithms is followed with the help of R package software.It should be noted that the process of improving the performance of the algorithms is achieved both with the help of the aforementioned techniques as well as with the testing and continuous execution of the respective software, since the aim of this thesis was to compare the results under optimal parameterization conditions.

- ### [Car rental database using MySQL,PHP,Javascript,HTML](https://github.com/GiwrgosN/CarRental)

Developed a website for a car rental company. The user could make revervations, delete a reservation or update an existing one. The car rental company could have many stores which the user would be able to choose from. The user interface was made using html,CSS and Javascript and all the data were stored in a database using MySQL.

- ### [Implementation of Four Russians Algorithm using Python](https://github.com/GiwrgosN/FourRussiansAlgorithm)

Four russians algorithm is a matrix multiplication algorithm. The main purpose of this project was to implement this algorithm in Python.

- ### [Computational-Statistics](https://github.com/GiwrgosN/Computational-Statistics)

Implementation of E-M algorithm, bootstrap for linear regression, Lasso, kernel density estimation, rejection method and cross validation in R.
