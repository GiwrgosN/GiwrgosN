- ### [NLP Using Wikidata Knowledge Graph](https://github.com/GiwrgosN/NLP-Wikidata-Knowledge-Graph)

This notebook demonstrates the utilization of the WikiData API and the Wikipedia API to gather comprehensive information about the winners of the prestigious ACM Turing Award. The ACM Turing Award, presented annually by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), recognizes individuals who have made significant and enduring contributions to the field of computer science.

*Tools*: Python 


- ### [Covid-19 UK Analysis](https://github.com/GiwrgosN/Covid-19-UK-Analysis)

The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a global challenge, necessitating swift and effective responses from governments worldwide. This comparative analysis aims to examine the vaccination strategies implemented across various regions in the United Kingdom and their impact on the escalation of COVID-19-related deaths. By evaluating the different approaches taken and their outcomes, we can gain insights into the effectiveness of these strategies and their potential implications.

*Tools*: Python 

- ### [Implementation of Four Russians Algorithm](https://github.com/GiwrgosN/FourRussiansAlgorithm)

Four russians algorithm is a matrix multiplication algorithm. The main purpose of this project was to implement this algorithm in Python.

*Tools*: Python 


- ### [Implementation of eCommerce-System](https://github.com/GiwrgosN/eCommerce-System)

This project is an implementation of a simple eCommerce system using Python.

*Tools*: Python 


- ### [Comparative Study of Clustering Algorithms with Application to Medical Data](https://github.com/GiwrgosN/Comparative-Study-of-Clustering-Algorithms-with-Application-to-Medical-Data)

In the context of my thesis for National Technical University of Athens, 3 clustering algorithms (K - means, Single Link, DBSCAN) are examined as well as their effectiveness with the use of medical data (patients with breast cancer). Purpose of applying these algorithms is the choice of the one with the best results as well as the answer to the question of whether they can be used to predict breast cancer.

*Tools*  : R  
*Dataset*: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Coimbra

- ### [Car Rental Database](https://github.com/GiwrgosN/CarRental)

Developed a website for a car rental company. The user could make revervations, delete a reservation or update an existing one. The car rental company could have many stores which the user would be able to choose from. The user interface was made using html,CSS and Javascript and all the data were stored in a database using MySQL.

*Tools*: MySQL, PHP, Javascript, jQuery, HTML, CSS
